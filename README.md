# bank-tech-test-java

## Exercise
Your task is to write an application that a user can call to make bank transactions and then print a bank statement to the terminal.

### Requirements
- Implement deposits and withdrawals
- Implement an account statement that prints a heading row, and the date, amount and balance of each transaction, most recent first.
- You don't need to implement a command-line or user interface, test-driving and calling it in your main method.
- Data can be kept in memory, doesn't need to be in a database.

### Acceptance Criteria

Below is an example of how your code should be called, and what it should output.

```
// For: src/main/java/tech/makers/bank/Main.java
// Note the package:
package tech.makers.bank;

import java.time.LocalDate;

public class Main {
public static void main(String args[]) {
BankAccount bankAccount = new BankAccount();

        // Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 2021-01-10
        bankAccount.deposit(1000, LocalDate.of(2021, 1, 10));

        // And a deposit of 2000 on 2021-01-13
        bankAccount.deposit(2000, LocalDate.of(2021, 1, 13));

        // And a withdrawal of 500 on 2021-01-14
        bankAccount.withdraw(500, LocalDate.of(2021, 1, 14));

        // When she prints her bank statement
        System.out.println(bankAccount.generateStatement());
    }
}
```
Then she would see:

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2021 || - || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2021 || 2000.00 || - || 3000.00
10/01/2021 || 1000.00 || - || 1000.00
```
